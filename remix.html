	<h2><center>Description</center></h2>

<p>This project is a teamwork based collaboration effort in which a previous assignment from this course is shifted into the medium of video. This means that the tone and mode of the video have shifted as well. The goal of the project is to revise and transmediate one of your group members previous projects from the semester into a personal narrative or documentary. You can choose from either the Lived Experiences Report, Cultural Analysis, Formal Research Project or you could just choose a social issue to compose your personal narrative or documentary on, and thus have to take advantage of new methods of presentation to communicate the same message as before. The requirements involved the video being around 7-9 minutes long and it must include text on the screen as well as talking in the video. The main point to this project was to expand on a past paper and go into more of a description about it. You really want to get your point across and make the video entertaining to keep the audience interested as well. Professor Daniels encouraged students to use more emotional words, and languages in order to convince your audiences and make your video more interesting. </p>

<h2>Tips and Advice</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>When working on this assignment, you must have an Idea of what exactly you’re trying to achieve with your video. For example, if you are trying to send a message to a certain audience, you should make sure that you have established that in one form or another and that you and all your groupmates agree on it. </p>

</li>
<li><p>Devise a series of strategies and tools you would want to use in order to successfully achieve your goal. For example, if you are trying to convince people to believe in a cause, a tool you can use is “pathos” or emotional appeal. </p>

</li>
<li><p>Emotional Appeal, or “pathos” can be powerful in documentary format if you know your audience and the things that engage them. For example, if you audience is college aged students, making references to things they would understand or using songs they recognize are effective in pushing them to connect to the video. </p>

</li>
<li><p>Ensure your video has a logical flow that is consistent throughout. If the pace is fast in the beginning but irrationally changes throughout, it would confuse the audience.The best course of action is to devise a flowchart of the parts of the video that each have a certain purpose and then use the flowchart to structure the actual production. </p>

</li>
<li><p>picking someone’s previous paper that they were truly interested in. That way you would know what you are talking about and you would have a ready supply of interviewees. </p>

</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p>Make time so that you can record and edit your video on time. A group chat on our phones, and on Google Drive allowed us to be able to communicate more easily.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p>Team cooperativeness is essential for this project, along with time management as there are various players involved in the success of this assignment.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p>Communicate with your partners early in the project, exchanging phone numbers and contact information, so everyone in the group is on board with the project, and the work can be divided up equally. </p>

</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p>Integrate more than one mode of communication in your film to make your film credible. These forms of communication include personal narrating, visual references, personal interviews or integrating other online videos on the topic.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Take advantage of your groupmates’ skillsets, past experiences and previous knowledge on the topic. </p>

</li>
</ul>

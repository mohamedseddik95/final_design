		<p>Our first project was the “Lived Experiences” paper. For this paper, we had to discuss our major at Michigan State and how a specific technology has influenced our decision to pursue the specific major. We had to explain the technology and how it relates to the major we are pursuing. We also had to talk about what we wanted to do as a career with that major and what we were required to do in that career. The assignment was presented in both a narrative form, along with a blog on our website. This major assignment required us to identify an academic track we have for ourselves, identify a piece of technology that has influenced us to choose the said field, and then describe our experiences with that piece of technology. For this assignment, it was important to engage with our audience, as they may not necessarily be too familiar with our chosen academic field and/or the technology. It’s crucial that a strong relationship between the technology and academic field is clearly demonstrated or explained in order to construct a concise narrative for the audience. This project required reflection moreover than research, since we had to reflect on a piece of technology and our own major. It was necessary that you are familiar with the discipline you chose to write about, as you had to connect it to a piece of technology. This assignment made me dig deep and think about the reason why I decided on the major I have chosen. We began this assignment with a draft, and there were several questions for us to answer. This was the beginning of thinking about what technology led you to choosing your major. The last question was to compose an outline of what you plan your paper to look like, and we submitted this to D2L for our peers to read. When you are reading your peers work yourself, I tried very hard to actually give them good feedback. You have to remember that this is the first time that they are taking a writing class in college too, so it's important to give constructive criticism. The feedback from this small group was all you recieved, so make sure you take what other people said about your piece into consideration because they are usually just trying to help make yours better. When you are writing your paper make sure to have a strong purpose. This assignment made me really think about what events have happened in my life, and how they have shaped me into choosing my major. The lived experiences assignment was our first assignment in which we had to identify our academic path and what technology has led us to choose that path.</p>

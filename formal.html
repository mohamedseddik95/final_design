			<p>In this assignment, you are supposed to talk about how writing is important or affects your discipline or major. You are free to choose witch discipline you like. However, you must use citation specifically scholarly and trade publication articles. You need to interview someone who is skilled in the discipline you choose. Your paper should be at least between 2700 and 3000 words. Your paper should also either use MLA or APA citation. It should also have a cover page.</p>	
			<p>First thing that you should do is research. You need to research for good articles that could help you with the citation part. Research is very important when it comes to writing, which is why I think this assignment was important. Once, you are done with citations you should look for someone to interview. It should be very easy meeting someone skilled at your major; you will definitely be taking a class that contributes to your writing therefore a professor that is adept at your major.</p>
			<p>Once you are done with the researching and interview, you should plan on how you will write the paper. This should be easy as long as you use an outline. After figuring out the outline, then you shouldn’t worry that much. You need to cite after finishing the essay; you can use either APA or MLA, but preferably MLA. Finally you shouldn’t forget about cover page.</p>

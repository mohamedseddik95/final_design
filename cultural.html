		<h1>What Is The Cultural Analysis and What Are Its Objectives</h1>
			<p>The cultural analysis is an in depth look at a social issue you are concerned with. The first thing you must do is research a specific social issue. Secondly, you must tie this social issue to an artifact of popular culture (TV shows, video games, music video, etc.) Then provide a detail analysis of how this artifact contributes to your social issue. If choosing an issue such as the deterioration of the modesty of the English language and the increase of profanity in music videos you would choose a music video and break down the specific examples of profanity in that video and how that contributes to other artists also following the trend of increasing profanity. Lastly, you will propose a solution that can help solve or improve this issue and the potential outcomes. This paper is formatted as a formal proposal, the reason being; formal proposals are a detrimental recourse in the technical workplace. The ability to identify and explain an issue while proposing potential solutions is an imperative skill that is needed throughout higher learning and in future jobs.</p>
		<h1>How to research it</h1>
			<p>How to research your topic is always one of the longest parts of writing a paper. You have to try and find a good source and then try to determine if that source is good for your paper. You should try to narrow your search down to get a smaller and smaller list. You can do this by making your search more specfic. You can do this by adding more key words to the phrase in the search bar. Another thing that can help is wikipedia. Now the things that are written on wikipedia are not a reliable source, but if you go to the bottom of the web page there is a reference section and those references can be very helpful. They can lead you to information that you can actually use in your paper. </p>

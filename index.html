			<h1>About the Course</h1>
			<p> WRA 110 is a course to increase writing research, analysis and many other skills that come handy during college. It is also based around exploring HTML and other technological aspects of the world today. It covers topics ranging from pop culture to in-depth research on majors provided at MSU all while learning how to create your own website. Programs such as Github and Codecademy are tools that were used to further students’ knowledge of coding and design using HTML. It is with the skills we honed from these applications that we had the ability to create the webpage that you see today. It is here you’ll find our work from the semester along with tips and advice for incoming students on how to best succeed in this course. We based our design off of the provided HTML code from the Github. We used that as a starting point and from there integrated our own unique design that we created ourselves. The end result came out as a more creative, unique and concise version of the original website. </p>
